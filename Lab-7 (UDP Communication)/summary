# Summary

1) Server creates a socket, binds it to an address and port, and waits for messages.

2) Client creates a socket and sends messages to the server.

3) Server receives messages and optionally sends a response.


# Applications

1) UDP is connectionless – No connect(), just sendto() and recvfrom().

2) Faster than TCP – No handshake, minimal overhead.

3) Unreliable – No guarantee of delivery, ordering, or retransmission.

4) Good for real-time applications like gaming and live-streaming.
