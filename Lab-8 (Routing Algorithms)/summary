LSR- Link State Routing:
- Each router builds a complete map of the network.
- Routers share link state info with all other routers.
- Uses Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path calculation.
- Example: OSPF
- Faster convergence, more accurate but complex and resource-heavy.

DSR– Distance Vector Routing:
- Each router only knows its neighbors and their distance.
- Routers share info only with direct neighbors.
- Uses Bellman-Ford algorithm to find shortest paths.
- Example: Routing Information Protocol
- Simple, uses less memory, but slower convergence and risk of routing loops.
